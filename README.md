BizzareDelay2014
================

The old BizzareDelay project has trouble compiling because it's 3 years old and the SDK has changed. This is a new refactored version 
that will compile properly with the new IPlug version. 

I have reconstructed the entire project from scratch by cloning IPlugEffect and copying in the old source files.
